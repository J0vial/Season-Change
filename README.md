# Season-Change
This is a project of Computer graphics where three types of season. 
1) Summer: There will be trees and sun and a static image will shown
2) Rainy: Rain will fall  to negative y axis using translation matrix and the trees will rotate0.9 degree [a little movement].
3) Winter: There will be no leaves and Snow will fall down.


To run this program You have to install openGL library.
Go to the following link: 

[Python Extension Packages for Windows - Christoph Gohlke (uci.edu)] and download the files with names as below:
**PyOpenGL‑3.1.6‑cp3x‑cp3x‑win_amd64.whl
**PyOpenGL_accelerate‑3.1.6‑cp3x‑cp3x‑win_amd64.whl
when your python version is 3.x
For example, if your python version is 3.6, replace 3x with 36.


Then, 
Open the PyCharm or MS VScode terminal (see figure) and run the following commands:
pip install PyOpenGL-3.1.5-cp3x-cp3xm-win_amd64.whl
pip install PyOpenGL_accelerate-3.1.5-cp3x-cp3xm-win_amd64.whl
